Built a 5-year financial forecast and valuation model for MR D.I.Y. using Python, Excel, and financial modeling principles.
# MR D.I.Y. Financial Forecast & Private Equity Case Study

This project is a **mini investment case study** applying private equityâ€“style financial modeling to MR D.I.Y. (Malaysiaâ€™s largest home improvement retailer).  
It demonstrates my ability to combine **data analytics, financial forecasting, and valuation techniques** using Python and Excel.  

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
- **Objective**: Estimate MR D.I.Y.â€™s revenue and EBITDA growth, derive valuation using EV/EBITDA multiples, and calculate expected returns for a private equity investor.  
- **Steps**:
  1. Built a **5-year revenue & EBITDA forecast** using growth rate assumptions.  
  2. Applied **entry & exit multiples** to estimate Enterprise Value (EV).  
  3. Calculated **equity returns (IRR)** based on leverage structure.  
  4. Summarized results in **Excel + charts** and a **professional-style investment memo**

## Key Parameters
- Starting Revenue (2025): RM 4,780 million  
- Growth Rate: 6% CAGR  
- EBITDA Margin: 20.5%  
- Entry & Exit Multiple: 10x EV/EBITDA  
- Debt Ratio: 60%  
- Holding Period: 5 years  

## Results
- **2029 Revenue**: ~RM 6.37 billion  
- **2029 EBITDA**: ~RM 1.31 billion  
- **Exit Enterprise Value**: ~RM 13.1 billion  
- **Equity IRR**: ~19%
